WAYA INTEGRATION - LIVE TESTING CHECKLIST
==========================================

Document Version: 1.0
Date: 2026-02-20
Test Type: End-to-End Integration Testing (Live Environment)
Participants: Moank Team + WAYA Team

**IMPORTANT:** This document focuses EXCLUSIVELY on testing the integration/communication 
between WAYA and Moank systems. Internal Moank decision rules, checks, and business logic 
are tested separately (see ISSUER_ONBOARDING_QA_CHECKLIST.md).


WHAT IS TESTED IN THIS DOCUMENT:
=================================
✓ Webhook delivery (WAYA → Moank)
✓ API calls for data fetching (Moank → WAYA: creditor, KYC, bank account, agreements)
✓ Status updates (Moank → WAYA: active=true/false)
✓ Data synchronization between systems
✓ Error handling (retries, timeouts, authentication failures)
✓ Idempotency and duplicate prevention
✓ Performance (API response times, end-to-end timing)


WHAT IS NOT TESTED HERE (Tested Separately):
============================================
✗ Moank internal decision rules (9 rules: industry code, failure score, KYC, sanctions, etc.)
✗ D&B and Creditsafe API integrations
✗ Blacklist service checks
✗ High-risk flagging and EDD workflows
✗ AML Manager checks
✗ Moank UI functionality
✗ Database schema validation

→ See ISSUER_ONBOARDING_QA_CHECKLIST.md for internal Moank testing


OVERVIEW
========

Purpose: Test integration/communication between Moank IF system and WAYA systems
Scope: Webhook delivery, API data exchange, status synchronization, error handling
Focus: INTEGRATION ONLY - Communication layer between two systems

Integration Flow (Communication Between Systems):
1. WAYA creates issuer/creditor in their system
2. WAYA sends boarding event/webhook to Moank → TEST: Webhook delivery
3. Moank receives webhook and fetches issuer data from WAYA APIs → TEST: Data fetching
4. Moank processes issuer (internal logic - BLACK BOX for this test)
5. If approved: Moank sends status update to WAYA (active = true) → TEST: Status delivery
6. If not approved: Moank does NOT send status → TEST: Verify no status sent
7. WAYA receives status and updates → TEST: Status synchronization

Key Testing Points:
- Webhook delivery (WAYA → Moank)
- API calls for data fetching (Moank → WAYA)
- Status updates (Moank → WAYA)
- Error handling and retries
- Idempotency
- Performance/timing

F. IMPORTANT: What Moank Does NOT Send to WAYA
-----------------------------------------------

The following information is kept INTERNAL to Moank and is NOT sent to WAYA:
- Decision reasons (why approved/denied/referred)
- Individual rule results (GRANTED, DENIED, REFERRED)
- High-risk flags (PEP, sanction, blacklist)
- EDD completion status
- Failure scores
- Industry codes
- D&B or Creditsafe results
- Any detailed explanation of decision logic

WAYA only receives: active = true/false

TOOLS & COMMANDS FOR INTEGRATION TESTING
================================================================================

Monitor Webhook Delivery (WAYA → Moank)
----------------------------------------
```bash
# Moank Team: Check webhook received
tail -f logs/waya-integration.log | grep "webhook.*creditor-boarded"

# WAYA Team: Check webhook sent
tail -f logs/webhook-delivery.log | grep "moank.*creditor-boarded"

# Moank Team: Query database for issuer created
psql -d moank_db -c "SELECT id, waya_creditor_id, status, created_at FROM issuers WHERE waya_creditor_id = 'cred_abc123';"
```


Monitor API Data Fetching (Moank → WAYA)
-----------------------------------------
```bash
# WAYA Team: Monitor API requests received from Moank
tail -f logs/api-access.log | grep "GET.*creditor.*moank"

# Moank Team: Monitor API calls made to WAYA
tail -f logs/waya-integration.log | grep "GET.*waya.*creditor"

# Check specific endpoints
tail -f logs/waya-integration.log | grep -E "(GET /api/creditor|GET /kyc|GET /bank-account|GET /agreements)"
```


Monitor Status Updates (Moank → WAYA)
--------------------------------------
```bash
# Moank Team: Check status update sent
tail -f logs/waya-integration.log | grep "PATCH.*status.*cred_abc123"

# WAYA Team: Check status update received
tail -f logs/api-access.log | grep "PATCH.*creditor.*status"

# WAYA Team: Verify status in database
# (WAYA specific database query)
```


Verify Status Synchronization (Both Systems)
---------------------------------------------
```bash
# Moank Team: Check Moank issuer status
psql -d moank_db -c "SELECT id, waya_creditor_id, aggregated_status, updated_at FROM issuers WHERE waya_creditor_id = 'cred_abc123';"

# WAYA Team: Check WAYA creditor status
# (WAYA specific database or API query)

# Or via APIs:
# Moank internal API
curl -X GET https://staging.moank-if.com/api/v1/internal/issuer/iss_xyz789 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOANK_TOKEN"

# WAYA API
curl -X GET https://api.waya.com/api/creditor/cred_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WAYA_TOKEN"
```


Check for Errors and Retries
-----------------------------
```bash
# Moank Team: Check for API errors
tail -f logs/waya-integration.log | grep -i "error\|retry\|timeout"

# WAYA Team: Check for webhook delivery errors
tail -f logs/webhook-delivery.log | grep -i "error\|retry\|failed"

# Moank Team: Check alerts
# (Check Slack channel or email for integration alerts)
```

DOCUMENT INFORMATION
================================================================================

Document Title: WAYA Integration - Live Testing Checklist
Version: 1.0
Created: 2026-02-20
Test Type: End-to-End Integration (Live)
Environment: Staging/Test

Related Documents:
- ISSUER_ONBOARDING_QA_CHECKLIST.md (for internal Moank decision rules testing)
- ISSUER_ONBOARDING_HAPPY_FLOW.md (for detailed Moank workflow)
- ISSUER_DECISION_RULES_TESTS.md (for detailed rule validation)

This Document Focus:
- WAYA ↔ Moank integration/communication ONLY
- Webhook delivery and API data exchange
- Status synchronization between systems
- Error handling at integration points

Next Steps After Testing:
1. Review integration test results with both teams
2. Fix identified integration issues (API, webhooks, synchronization)
3. Schedule retest for failed integration scenarios
4. Complete internal Moank testing separately (decision rules, checks)
5. Plan production rollout when BOTH integration AND internal tests pass

Note: This test validates the INTEGRATION LAYER only. Internal Moank business logic 
(decision rules, risk assessment, etc.) is validated separately in other test suites.
