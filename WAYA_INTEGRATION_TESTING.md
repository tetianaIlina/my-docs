## 📖 Overview

**Purpose:** Test integration/communication between Moank IF system and WAYA systems  
**Scope:** Webhook delivery, API data exchange, status synchronization, error handling  
**Focus:** INTEGRATION ONLY - Communication layer between two systems

### Integration Flow (Communication Between Systems)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant WAYA
    participant Moank
    
    WAYA->>Moank: 1. POST /webhook/creditor-boarded
    Note over WAYA,Moank: TEST: Webhook delivery
    
    Moank->>WAYA: 2. GET /api/creditor/:id
    Moank->>WAYA: 3. GET /api/creditor/:id/kyc
    Moank->>WAYA: 4. GET /api/creditor/:id/bank-account
    Moank->>WAYA: 5. GET /api/creditor/:id/agreements
    Note over WAYA,Moank: TEST: Data fetching
    
    Note over Moank: 6. Process issuer (internal - black box)
    
    alt Approved
        Moank->>WAYA: 7a. PATCH /status (active=true)
        Note over WAYA,Moank: TEST: Status delivery
    else Not Approved
        Note over Moank: 7b. No status sent
        Note over WAYA,Moank: TEST: Verify no status sent
    end
```

**Numbered Steps:**
1. WAYA creates issuer/creditor in their system
2. WAYA sends boarding event/webhook to Moank → **TEST: Webhook delivery**
3. Moank receives webhook and fetches issuer data from WAYA APIs → **TEST: Data fetching**
4. Moank processes issuer (internal logic - **BLACK BOX** for this test)
5. If approved: Moank sends status update to WAYA (active = true) → **TEST: Status delivery**
6. If not approved: Moank does NOT send status → **TEST: Verify no status sent**
7. WAYA receives status and updates → **TEST: Status synchronization**

### 🎯 Key Testing Points

- 📤 Webhook delivery (WAYA → Moank)
- 📥 API calls for data fetching (Moank → WAYA)
- 🔄 Status updates (Moank → WAYA)
- ⚠️ Error handling and retries
- 🔁 Idempotency
- ⚡ Performance/timing

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Section 1: Happy Path - Approved Issuer

**Test Scenario:** WAYA creates valid issuer, Moank approves and activates  
**Expected Outcome:** Issuer becomes ACTIVE in both systems

- [ ] **1.1** Create issuer in WAYA `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA UI/API: Create creditor with valid org# (e.g., 556677889), country = SE, complete KYC data

- [ ] **1.2** Verify issuer created in WAYA `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA shows: creditorId generated, status = "PENDING_APPROVAL", all data saved

- [ ] **1.3** WAYA sends webhook to Moank `[WAYA System]`  
  → POST to Moank /webhook/creditor-boarded with: creditorId, organisationNumber, country, timestamp

- [ ] **1.4** Verify webhook received `[Both Teams]`  
  → Moank logs: "Webhook received: creditorId = ...", HTTP 200 response sent to WAYA

- [ ] **1.5** Verify Moank fetches issuer data `[Both Teams]`  
  → GET /api/creditor/:creditorId → WAYA logs show request received, returns: name, org#, country, address

- [ ] **1.6** Verify Moank fetches KYC data `[Both Teams]`  
  → GET /api/creditor/:creditorId/kyc → WAYA returns beneficial owners data

- [ ] **1.7** Verify Moank fetches bank account `[Both Teams]`  
  → GET /api/creditor/:creditorId/bank-account → WAYA returns IBAN, bank name

- [ ] **1.8** Verify Moank fetches agreements `[Both Teams]`  
  → GET /api/creditor/:creditorId/agreements → WAYA returns signed agreement data

- [ ] **1.9** Moank processes issuer `[Moank Team]`  
  → Moank evaluates issuer (internal checks - see [ISSUER_ONBOARDING_QA_CHECKLIST.md](./ISSUER_ONBOARDING_QA_CHECKLIST.md))

- [ ] **1.10** Moank issuer becomes ACTIVE `[Moank Team]`  
  → Query Moank database: `aggregatedStatus = 'ACTIVE'`

- [ ] **1.11** Moank sends status update to WAYA `[Moank System]`  
  → PATCH /api/creditor/:creditorId/status with: `active = true`

- [ ] **1.12** WAYA receives status update `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA logs show status update received, HTTP 200 response sent

- [ ] **1.13** WAYA updates issuer to ACTIVE `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA database/UI shows: creditor status = "ACTIVE"

- [ ] **1.14** Verify status synchronized `[Both Teams]`  
  → Moank query: status = ACTIVE, WAYA query: status = ACTIVE

- [ ] **1.15** Test invoice creation ready `[Both Teams]`  
  → WAYA UI shows issuer as active and ready for invoicing


#### Expected Integration Results

- ✅ Webhook delivery successful (WAYA → Moank)
- ✅ All data fetching API calls successful (Moank → WAYA)
- ✅ Status update sent successfully (Moank → WAYA with `active=true`)

---

### Section 2: Denied/Not Approved Scenario

**Test Scenario:** WAYA creates issuer, Moank does NOT approve (stays inactive)  
**Expected Outcome:** Issuer remains NOT ACTIVE, no status update sent to WAYA

- [ ] **2.1** Create issuer with problematic data `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA: Create creditor with data that will be denied by Moank (e.g., denied industry)

- [ ] **2.2** Verify issuer created in WAYA `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA shows: creditorId generated, status = "PENDING_APPROVAL"

- [ ] **2.3** WAYA sends webhook to Moank `[WAYA System]`  
  → POST to Moank /webhook/creditor-boarded

- [ ] **2.4** Verify webhook received `[Both Teams]`  
  → Moank logs webhook received, HTTP 200 sent

- [ ] **2.5** Verify Moank fetches all data `[Both Teams]`  
  → WAYA logs show all API requests (issuer, KYC, bank, agreements) received

- [ ] **2.6** Moank processes issuer `[Moank Team]`  
  → Moank evaluates issuer (internal checks result in denial)

- [ ] **2.7** Moank issuer stays INACTIVE `[Moank Team]`  
  → Query Moank database: `aggregatedStatus = 'INACTIVE'`

- [ ] **2.8** Moank does NOT send status to WAYA `[Both Teams]`  
  → No PATCH /status call made to WAYA (verify WAYA logs show no status update)

- [ ] **2.9** WAYA issuer remains in pending state `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA status still "PENDING_APPROVAL" (never activated)

- [ ] **2.10** Verify no active flag sent `[Both Teams]`  
  → WAYA API logs: No status update received from Moank

- [ ] **2.11** WAYA cannot activate invoice creation `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA UI: Issuer not shown as active, invoicing not enabled


#### Expected Integration Results

- ✅ Webhook delivery successful (WAYA → Moank)
- ✅ Data fetching successful (Moank → WAYA)
- ✅ **NO status update sent to WAYA** (verified in logs)
- ✅ WAYA issuer remains in PENDING_APPROVAL state
- ✅ Integration behaves correctly: no activation when not approved
- ✅ No detailed denial reasons communicated (by design - integration works as specified)

### Section 3: Pending Review - Data Update & Re-evaluation

**Test Scenario:** Issuer initially incomplete, data updated, then approved  
**Expected Outcome:** After data update and Moank approval, issuer becomes ACTIVE

- [ ] **3.1** Create issuer with incomplete data `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA: Create creditor with incomplete KYC data (e.g., missing beneficial owners)

- [ ] **3.2** WAYA sends webhook `[WAYA System]`  
  → POST to Moank /webhook/creditor-boarded

- [ ] **3.3** Verify webhook and data fetching `[Both Teams]`  
  → Moank receives webhook, fetches all data from WAYA APIs

- [ ] **3.4** Moank processes issuer `[Moank Team]`  
  → Moank evaluation identifies incomplete data

- [ ] **3.5** Moank issuer status = NEED_ACTION `[Moank Team]`  
  → Query Moank: `aggregatedStatus = 'NEED_ACTION'` (awaiting data or manual review)

- [ ] **3.6** Moank does NOT send status to WAYA `[Both Teams]`  
  → No status update sent (verify WAYA logs)

- [ ] **3.7** WAYA issuer remains pending `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA status still "PENDING_APPROVAL"

- [ ] **3.8** WAYA updates issuer data `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA: Complete missing data (add beneficial owners)

- [ ] **3.9** WAYA triggers re-evaluation `[WAYA System]`  
  → Send webhook /creditor-updated OR Moank polls for updates

- [ ] **3.10** Moank re-fetches updated data `[Moank System]`  
  → GET /api/creditor/:creditorId/kyc → WAYA returns complete data

- [ ] **3.11** Moank re-evaluates issuer `[Moank Team]`  
  → Moank processes with updated data (may require manual approval)

- [ ] **3.12** Moank operator approves manually `[Moank Team]`  
  → If needed: Moank UI → Manual approval → Status changes to ACTIVE

- [ ] **3.13** Moank sends status update to WAYA `[Moank System]`  
  → PATCH /api/creditor/:creditorId/status with: `active = true`

- [ ] **3.14** WAYA receives status update `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA logs show status update received

- [ ] **3.15** WAYA updates to ACTIVE `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA status = "ACTIVE", issuer can now create invoices

- [ ] **3.16** Verify status synchronized `[Both Teams]`  
  → Moank: ACTIVE, WAYA: ACTIVE


#### Expected Integration Results

- ⚠️ Initial: NO status sent to WAYA, WAYA remains PENDING
- ✅ Data update notification delivered (WAYA → Moank)
- ✅ Moank re-fetches updated data successfully
- ✅ After approval: Status update sent (Moank → WAYA with `active=true`)
- ✅ Status synchronized after resolution
- ✅ Complete integration cycle works: webhook → fetch → update → re-fetch → status

### Section 4: Manual Deactivation - Status Synchronization

**Test Scenario:** Active issuer is manually deactivated in Moank  
**Expected Outcome:** Inactive status flag sent to WAYA, both systems synchronized

- [ ] **4.1** Start with ACTIVE issuer `[Both Teams]`  
  → Prerequisite: Issuer already ACTIVE in both Moank and WAYA

- [ ] **4.2** Verify initial state `[Both Teams]`  
  → Moank: status = ACTIVE, WAYA: status = ACTIVE

- [ ] **4.3** Moank operator deactivates issuer `[Moank Team]`  
  → Moank UI: Select issuer → Click "Deactivate" → Confirm

- [ ] **4.4** Moank issuer becomes INACTIVE `[Moank Team]`  
  → Query Moank: `aggregatedStatus = 'INACTIVE'`

- [ ] **4.5** Moank sends status update to WAYA `[Moank System]`  
  → PATCH /api/creditor/:creditorId/status with: `active = false`

- [ ] **4.6** WAYA receives status update `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA logs show status update received with `active = false`

- [ ] **4.7** WAYA updates issuer to INACTIVE `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA status = "INACTIVE" or "DEACTIVATED"

- [ ] **4.8** Verify status synchronized `[Both Teams]`  
  → Moank: INACTIVE, WAYA: INACTIVE/DEACTIVATED

- [ ] **4.9** WAYA blocks invoice creation `[WAYA Team]`  
  → WAYA UI: Invoice creation disabled for this issuer


#### Expected Integration Results

- ✅ Status update sent successfully (Moank → WAYA with `active=false`)
- ✅ WAYA received status update (verified in logs)
- ✅ WAYA processed update and changed status to INACTIVE
- ✅ Both systems synchronized (Moank INACTIVE, WAYA INACTIVE)
- ✅ Integration works bidirectionally: can send both `active=true` and `active=false`
- ✅ No detailed reason sent (by design - integration behavior correct)

- [ ] **5.24** Verify Moank token refresh attempt `[Moank Team]` → Moank requests new JWT token and retries
- [ ] **5.25** WAYA Team fixes authentication `[WAYA Team]` → Restore correct authentication configuration
- [ ] **5.26** Moank retry succeeds `[Both Teams]` → Moank successfully fetches data with refreshed token


#### 5.3 Webhook Delivery Failure

- [ ] **5.31** Simulate Moank webhook endpoint down `[Moank Team]` → Stop Moank webhook service temporarily
- [ ] **5.32** WAYA attempts to send webhook `[WAYA System]` → POST to Moank /webhook/creditor-boarded → Connection timeout or 503
- [ ] **5.33** Verify WAYA logs webhook failure `[WAYA Team]` → WAYA logs: "Webhook delivery failed to Moank"
- [ ] **5.34** Verify WAYA retry mechanism `[WAYA Team]` → WAYA retry logic: attempts webhook delivery multiple times with delays
- [ ] **5.35** Moank service restored `[Moank Team]` → Restart Moank webhook service
- [ ] **5.36** WAYA retry succeeds `[Both Teams]` → WAYA logs: "Webhook delivered successfully", Moank logs: "Webhook received"
- [ ] **5.37** Verify idempotency `[Moank Team]` → If duplicate webhooks → Only process once (check eventId)

- [ ] **6.6** Verify WAYA API calls logged `[WAYA Team]` → WAYA logs show all re-fetch requests from Moank
- [ ] **6.7** Moank re-evaluates issuer `[Moank Team]` → Moank processes issuer with updated data
- [ ] **6.8** If status changes, Moank sends update `[Moank System]` → PATCH /api/creditor/:creditorId/status (only if status actually changes)
- [ ] **6.9** Verify status synchronized `[Both Teams]` → If status changed: both systems reflect new status

### Section 9: Integration Negative Tests

#### 9.1 Invalid Webhook Payload

- [ ] **ER001** Webhook with missing creditorId → Moank returns HTTP 422, error: "creditorId is required"
- [ ] **ER002** Webhook with invalid creditorId format → Moank returns HTTP 422, error: "Invalid creditorId format"
- [ ] **ER003** Webhook with missing organisationNumber → Moank returns HTTP 422, validation error
- [ ] **ER004** Webhook with invalid country code → Moank returns HTTP 422, error: "Invalid country code"
- [ ] **ER005** Webhook without authentication → Moank returns HTTP 401
- [ ] **ER006** Webhook with expired token → Moank returns HTTP 401, error: "Token expired"


#### 9.2 WAYA API Returns Invalid/Incomplete Data

- [ ] **ER101** WAYA returns malformed JSON → Moank logs error, evaluation cannot complete
- [ ] **ER102** WAYA returns null IBAN → Moank handles missing data
- [ ] **ER103** WAYA returns BO with missing DOB → Moank handles incomplete data
- [ ] **ER104** WAYA returns empty BO array → Moank handles missing KYC
- [ ] **ER105** WAYA agreement not signed → Moank handles unsigned agreement


#### 9.3 Network & Timeout Issues

- [ ] **ER201** WAYA API slow response (> 30s) → Moank timeout, logs error, evaluation cannot complete
- [ ] **ER202** Network disconnect during fetch → Moank handles gracefully, retries when network restored

---

### Section 10: Duplicate Prevention & Idempotency

- [ ] **ID001** Duplicate webhook with same eventId → First processed, second ignored with log: "Duplicate event"
- [ ] **ID002** Create same issuer twice → WAYA sends 2 webhooks for same org# + country → Second returns HTTP 409 or is ignored
- [ ] **ID003** Retry failed webhook (same eventId) → Webhook fails first time, WAYA retries with same eventId → Should process successfully (idempotent)
- [ ] **ID004** Status update already sent → Moank sends status update to WAYA twice → WAYA handles gracefully, no duplicate processing

# WAYA Team: Check WAYA creditor status
# (WAYA specific database or API query)

# Or via APIs:
# Moank internal API
curl -X GET https://staging.moank-if.com/api/v1/internal/issuer/iss_xyz789 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOANK_TOKEN"

# WAYA API
curl -X GET https://api.waya.com/api/creditor/cred_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WAYA_TOKEN"
```

## 📄 Document Information

**Document Title:** WAYA Integration - Live Testing Checklist  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2026-02-20  
**Test Type:** End-to-End Integration (Live)  
**Environment:** Staging/Test

### Related Documents

- [ISSUER_ONBOARDING_QA_CHECKLIST.md](./ISSUER_ONBOARDING_QA_CHECKLIST.md) - Internal Moank decision rules testing
- [ISSUER_ONBOARDING_HAPPY_FLOW.md](./ISSUER_ONBOARDING_HAPPY_FLOW.md) - Detailed Moank workflow
- [ISSUER_DECISION_RULES_TESTS.md](./ISSUER_DECISION_RULES_TESTS.md) - Detailed rule validation

### This Document Focus

- ✅ WAYA ↔ Moank integration/communication ONLY
- ✅ Webhook delivery and API data exchange
- ✅ Status synchronization between systems
- ✅ Error handling at integration points

### Next Steps After Testing

1. Review integration test results with both teams
2. Fix identified integration issues (API, webhooks, synchronization)
3. Schedule retest for failed integration scenarios
4. Complete internal Moank testing separately (decision rules, checks)
5. Plan production rollout when **BOTH** integration AND internal tests pass

> [!NOTE]
> This test validates the **INTEGRATION LAYER only**. Internal Moank business logic (decision rules, risk assessment, etc.) is validated separately in other test suites.
