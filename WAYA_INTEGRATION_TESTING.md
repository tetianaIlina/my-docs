## 📖 Overview

**Purpose:** Test integration/communication between Moank IF system and WAYA systems  
**Scope:** Webhook delivery, API data exchange, status synchronization, error handling  
**Focus:** INTEGRATION ONLY - Communication layer between two systems

### Integration Flow (Communication Between Systems)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant WAYA
    participant Moank
    
    WAYA->>Moank: 1. POST /webhook/creditor-boarded
    Note over WAYA,Moank: TEST: Webhook delivery
    
    Moank->>WAYA: 2. GET /api/creditor/:id
    Moank->>WAYA: 3. GET /api/creditor/:id/kyc
    Moank->>WAYA: 4. GET /api/creditor/:id/bank-account
    Moank->>WAYA: 5. GET /api/creditor/:id/agreements
    Note over WAYA,Moank: TEST: Data fetching
    
    Note over Moank: 6. Process issuer (internal - black box)
    
    alt Approved
        Moank->>WAYA: 7a. PATCH /status (active=true)
        Note over WAYA,Moank: TEST: Status delivery
    else Not Approved
        Note over Moank: 7b. No status sent
        Note over WAYA,Moank: TEST: Verify no status sent
    end
```

**Numbered Steps:**
1. WAYA creates issuer/creditor in their system
2. WAYA sends boarding event/webhook to Moank → **TEST: Webhook delivery**
3. Moank receives webhook and fetches issuer data from WAYA APIs → **TEST: Data fetching**
4. Moank processes issuer (internal logic - **BLACK BOX** for this test)
5. If approved: Moank sends status update to WAYA (active = true) → **TEST: Status delivery**
6. If not approved: Moank does NOT send status → **TEST: Verify no status sent**
7. WAYA receives status and updates → **TEST: Status synchronization**

### 🎯 Key Testing Points

- 📤 Webhook delivery (WAYA → Moank)
- 📥 API calls for data fetching (Moank → WAYA)
- 🔄 Status updates (Moank → WAYA)
- ⚠️ Error handling and retries
- 🔁 Idempotency
- ⚡ Performance/timing

2.8  | Moank does NOT send status to WAYA        | Both Teams      | No PATCH /status call made to WAYA (verify WAYA logs show no status update) | ○ |
2.9  | WAYA issuer remains in pending state      | WAYA Team       | WAYA status still "PENDING_APPROVAL" (never activated) | ○ |
2.10 | Verify no active flag sent                | Both Teams      | WAYA API logs: No status update received from Moank | ○ |
2.11 | WAYA cannot activate invoice creation     | WAYA Team       | WAYA UI: Issuer not shown as active, invoicing not enabled | ○ |

2. Not approved: Issuer not activated, no status sent (org# [to be provided])
3. Data update: Re-evaluation after WAYA updates data
4. Manual deactivation: Status synchronization test
5. Error handling: API failures, webhook retries, timeouts

**Communication:**

psql -d moank_db -c "SELECT id, waya_creditor_id, status, created_at FROM issuers WHERE waya_creditor_id = 'cred_abc123';"
```


### Monitor API Data Fetching (Moank → WAYA)
```bash
# WAYA Team: Monitor API requests received from Moank
tail -f logs/api-access.log | grep "GET.*creditor.*moank"

# Moank Team: Monitor API calls made to WAYA
tail -f logs/waya-integration.log | grep "GET.*waya.*creditor"

# Check specific endpoints
tail -f logs/waya-integration.log | grep -E "(GET /api/creditor|GET /kyc|GET /bank-account|GET /agreements)"
```


### Monitor Status Updates (Moank → WAYA)
```bash
# Moank Team: Check status update sent
tail -f logs/waya-integration.log | grep "PATCH.*status.*cred_abc123"

# WAYA Team: Check status update received
tail -f logs/api-access.log | grep "PATCH.*creditor.*status"

# WAYA Team: Verify status in database
# (WAYA specific database query)
```


### Verify Status Synchronization (Both Systems)
```bash
# Moank Team: Check Moank issuer status
psql -d moank_db -c "SELECT id, waya_creditor_id, aggregated_status, updated_at FROM issuers WHERE waya_creditor_id = 'cred_abc123';"

# WAYA Team: Check WAYA creditor status
# (WAYA specific database or API query)

# Or via APIs:
# Moank internal API
curl -X GET https://staging.moank-if.com/api/v1/internal/issuer/iss_xyz789 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MOANK_TOKEN"

# WAYA API
curl -X GET https://api.waya.com/api/creditor/cred_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WAYA_TOKEN"
```


### Check for Errors and Retries

[↑ Back to top](#-waya-integration---live-testing-checklist)
```bash
# Moank Team: Check for API errors
tail -f logs/waya-integration.log | grep -i "error\|retry\|timeout"

# WAYA Team: Check for webhook delivery errors
tail -f logs/webhook-delivery.log | grep -i "error\|retry\|failed"

# Moank Team: Check alerts

## 📄 Document Information

**Document Title:** WAYA Integration - Live Testing Checklist  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2026-02-20  
**Test Type:** End-to-End Integration (Live)  
**Environment:** Staging/Test

### Related Documents

- [ISSUER_ONBOARDING_QA_CHECKLIST.md](./ISSUER_ONBOARDING_QA_CHECKLIST.md) - Internal Moank decision rules testing
- [ISSUER_ONBOARDING_HAPPY_FLOW.md](./ISSUER_ONBOARDING_HAPPY_FLOW.md) - Detailed Moank workflow
- [ISSUER_DECISION_RULES_TESTS.md](./ISSUER_DECISION_RULES_TESTS.md) - Detailed rule validation

### This Document Focus

- ✅ WAYA ↔ Moank integration/communication ONLY
- ✅ Webhook delivery and API data exchange
- ✅ Status synchronization between systems
- ✅ Error handling at integration points

### Next Steps After Testing

1. Review integration test results with both teams
2. Fix identified integration issues (API, webhooks, synchronization)
3. Schedule retest for failed integration scenarios
4. Complete internal Moank testing separately (decision rules, checks)
5. Plan production rollout when **BOTH** integration AND internal tests pass
